# Workflow Guidelines

## First Step for Any Task
- Before starting work on any task, always check the `.cursor/rules/tasks` directory for relevant guidance
- Look for files matching your task type (e.g., `[400-testing.md](mdc:.cursor/rules/tasks/401-test-generation.md)` for test generation)
- These documents contain established workflows, conventions, and requirements specific to each task type
- Following these task-specific rules will ensure consistency and reduce rework
- If multiple rule files seem relevant, review all of them before proceeding
