      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Foundation",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js 15 project setup into specific implementation steps including project initialization, Tailwind CSS configuration, Shadcn UI setup, folder structure creation, and code quality tools setup.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with well-defined steps. While it involves multiple technologies (Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI), these are standard integrations with good documentation. The complexity is moderate because it requires proper configuration of multiple frameworks, but the steps are straightforward."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the step-by-step implementation of BetterAuth with GitHub integration, including OAuth setup, API route creation, middleware implementation, UI component development, and user context provider configuration.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication involves security considerations and integration with third-party services (GitHub OAuth). It requires both frontend and backend work, including session management, protected routes, and database integration. The complexity is high due to the critical nature of auth systems and the potential for security issues."

      "taskTitle": "Set Up Database and ORM",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the specific steps for PostgreSQL database setup with PrismaORM, including database instance creation, schema definition for core models, migration script development, repository pattern implementation, and connection optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Database setup requires careful planning of data models and relationships. The complexity comes from designing an efficient schema that meets application requirements while implementing proper data access patterns. Connection pooling and migration scripts add additional complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement tRPC API Layer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for the tRPC API layer, including initial setup, router creation with procedure definitions, input validation with Zod, and client-side hook development for API consumption.",
      "reasoning": "tRPC implementation requires strong TypeScript knowledge and careful API design. The complexity comes from ensuring type safety across the full stack, implementing proper validation, and integrating with the authentication system. Error handling and creating a clean API surface adds to the complexity."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Garden Creation UI",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the garden creation interface development into form design, validation implementation, API integration, and garden listing page creation with edit/delete functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves form design and validation with moderate complexity. The integration with tRPC adds some complexity, but the overall task is relatively straightforward UI development with clear requirements for inputs and outputs."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Container Management",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for container management, including React DnD setup, container type library creation, interactive garden layout development, container placement logic, and container property panel implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI interactions with drag-and-drop functionality. The garden layout with grid system and position validation adds significant complexity. The interactive nature of this feature with multiple UI states and validation rules makes it one of the more complex tasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Crop Selection System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for implementing the crop selection system, including database seeding, browsing interface creation, detail view development, container assignment functionality, and recommendation logic implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires both database work and complex UI development. The recommendation logic based on container properties and environmental factors adds significant complexity. The system needs to handle relationships between crops and containers while providing useful recommendations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Task Management System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task management system implementation into data model creation, task creation form development, task listing with filters, completion tracking, and notification system setup.",
      "reasoning": "Task management involves moderate complexity with various UI components and state management. The notification system and recurrence patterns add some complexity, but the overall functionality follows standard task management patterns."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Basic AI Assistant",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for AI assistant integration, including Vercel AI SDK setup, chat UI implementation, prompt engineering, context injection development, knowledge base creation, and conversation history management.",
      "reasoning": "AI integration involves complex prompt engineering and stream-based UI. Working with LLMs requires careful context management and error handling. The real-time nature of the chat interface and knowledge base integration make this a highly complex task."
